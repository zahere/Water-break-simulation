# Water-break-simulation
Collecting and characterizing Mei Bat-yam organization by quantitative and qualitative parameters,
Analyzing processes and identifying problems, prioritizing them, and select which to be handled in terms of expected utility theory. The major problem was that more than 30% of the times the pipe breaks repair response time exceed the allowed Standard time. We provided multiple heuristics solutions proven with system model simulation.
